# ClaimConnect 🚑💳  
*A Spring Boot Microservices & React-Based Insurance Claim Processing System*  

---

## 📌 Overview  
**ClaimConnect** is a microservices-based **insurance claim processing system** built using **Spring Boot (backend)** and **React (frontend)**.  
It provides a scalable and modular architecture with **Eureka Server, Config Server, and API Gateway**, ensuring **service discovery, centralized configuration, and secure API routing**.  

The system enables patients, hospitals, and insurance companies to interact seamlessly for **claim submission, verification, and settlement**.  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview  

1. **React Frontend**  
   - Provides an intuitive UI for claim submission and tracking  
   - Interacts with backend services via API Gateway  

2. **API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)**  
   - Routes client requests to the correct microservice  
   - Provides authentication & load balancing  

3. **Eureka Server (Service Discovery)**  
   - Registers all microservices dynamically  
   - Enables seamless inter-service communication  

4. **Spring Cloud Config Server**  
   - Centralized configuration management  
   - Fetches configs from a GitHub repo for version control  

5. **Microservices**  
   - **Claim-Request Service** → Handles claim submissions, approvals, and processing  
   - **Hospital Service** → Manages hospital records & treatment details  
   - **Patient Service** → Stores and manages patient data  
   - **Insurance Company Service** → Manages policies, verifications, and settlements
